This project aims to implement simple statistical tools for people

* PCA - Principal Component Analysis

The PCA analyses rectangular data tables with individuals as lines and
quantitative variables as columns.

A table has 1..K variables and 1..I individuals.

For a variable =k=, we note the mean ([[fig:pca-mean]]) and the standard deviation ([[fig:std-dev]]).

It is possible to see the table in two different ways: as a set of lines, or as a set of columns.
For individuals (lines), we aim to understand when individuals are similar given the whole set of variables.
For variables (columns), we want to understand similarities between variables (bonds). 
These can be measured via the correlation coefficient: two variables having a high correlation (near 1) will be variables that contain the same information.
The PCA allows to find good indicators that summarize one or several variables.

The study of individuals and the one of variables are related:
