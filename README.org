This project aims to implement simple statistical tools for people
learning statistics.

* PCA - Principal Component Analysis

The PCA analyses rectangular data tables with individuals as lines and
quantitative variables as columns.

The PCA is an exploratory/descriptive method.

A table has 1..K variables and 1..I individuals.

For a variable =k=, we note the mean ([[fig:pca-mean]]) and the standard deviation ([[fig:std-dev]]).

It is possible to see the table in two different ways: as a set of lines, or as a set of columns.
For individuals (lines), we aim to understand when individuals are similar given the whole set of variables.
For variables (columns), we want to understand similarities between variables (bonds). 
These can be measured via the correlation coefficient: two variables having a high correlation (near 1) will be variables that contain the same information.
The PCA allows to find good indicators that summarize one or several variables.

The study of individuals and the one of variables are related:
 - we can classify individuals from variables
 - it is possible to depict variable's bonds with specific individuals (e.g. tall people are heavy whereas small ones are light).

** Visualize individuals

For K dimensions, it's not always possible to visualize individuals 'clouds':

 - K = 1: one axis
 - K = 2: 2D graph
 - K = 3: 3D graph
 - K >= 4: not possible.

If K >= 4, in order to find a visualization, we wanna know how to measure similarities between individuals.
Two individuals are similar when they take similar values on the set of K variables.

The shape of the cloud will inform us about individuals' relations.
