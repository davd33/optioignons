This project aims to implement simple statistical tools for people
learning statistics.

* PCA - Principal Component Analysis

The PCA analyses rectangular data tables with individuals as lines and
quantitative variables as columns.

A table as 1..K variables and 1..I individuals.

For a variable =k=, we note:
 - mean: x_k = (* (/ 1 I) (sum 1..I x
 - standard deviation: s_k = sqrt((1/I) * sum(squared(1..I)(x_ik - ~x_k)))
